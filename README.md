# Hi there!

I'm a Data Scientist with an interdisciplinary background in biomedical science, data science, and ethics. I'm enthusiastic about AI/ML applications to solve business and research questions in the life sciences industry. I'm always learning new things to keep up with: a) trends in research/industry; and b) my own imposter syndrome.

Data Skillset: 
- Python (tensorflow/keras, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- R (Shiny, caret, ggplot2, MICE, dplyr, nlme)
- Google Cloud Platform (AI/ML, Computer vision, Hadoop, Spark)
- SAS (advanced %macros, proc (datasets, contents, sql, etc.), data step)
- SQL (basic to advanced functions - join, group by, cursors, etc.)
